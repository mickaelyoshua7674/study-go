## Null Values
All Go value types come with a "null value" by default, if no value
is given for the variable, it will automaticaly hava a default value:
* int -> 0
* float -> 0.0
* string -> ""
* bool -> false

If there is a modulo in the same folder as your code, it's possible
run the code with just `go run .` to run the module.
